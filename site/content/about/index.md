# About this site

This site is definitely a **work in progress**!

My goal is to, at least initally, consolidate some useful homelab information to help others get their feet wet. Over time, this may grow to include more information/tutorials about hardware, software, networking, etc.

The source code for this site can be found [here](https://github.com/OverlyDev/Homelab).
